            Over more than 15 years, we had built nearly everything around a couple in Lutherville, Md&apos;s home: the front masonry porch, 2 walks, planting beds, landscape lighting front and back, and the rear bluestone patio with natural stone seat wall. As I walk around the house today, I look with pride, as everything we had built was beautiful artwork that settled in with no trip hazards or visual blemishes.

            In the fall of 2025 the husband had a friend send him a picture of an outdoor fireplace that the friend built himself. Large scale, about the same dimensions as Project Wildfire (14 ft wide x 14ish ft tall). The wife, knowing that the husband loved to sit outside on the patio we had built for them and smoke his cigars, said, &quot;Why don&apos;t you have Scott build one for you.&quot; As he was currently sitting around a small metal firepit, she felt like he earned an upgrade.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base py-2">
            The husband reached out to me, sent me the picture his friend had sent him. I sent him a link of Lew&apos;s Fireplace, and asked what he thought of that style. We had not yet agreed to a price, but he said, &quot;Put us into your schedule.&quot;

            Truly, I felt like the ideas just flowed out of me almost on auto pilot, it was almost effortless, with very little thinking. I do many other types of art, including music, stand-up comedy, graphic design, and generally these things are painstaking, iteration after iteration, seriously heavy brain work that takes days and months to get right. But to my amazement, in about 2 hours, I had something I really liked, the design above.

            The day after I got the go ahead, I started stone hunting.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base ">
            Sourcing the stone was tricky. All of the larger pieces were to be one-of-a-kind, selected individually for how well they fit into the actual design. Finding these stones was going to take patience, experience, traveling, and none were going to come cheap.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base ">
            I visited numerous retailers and quarries, and took every stone in the design and did my best to find it in reality. The high horizontal stone in the original design was drawn at almost 12 feet wide. I couldn&apos;t find anything that big, but I found a stone 10&apos; with cutouts on each end. I found the other stones, literally one at a time, from various sources, and then erased and redrew the design with the new stones in place, above.

            I took about 2 hours, and started into more curved outer edges. I abandoned the concept after numerous iterations, as I just could not get anything to look pleasing. As I look at it now upon writing this, this style of design could perhaps be magnificent for a future build. King Cobra.
